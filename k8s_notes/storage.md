the container file system is ephemeral. files on the container's file system exist only as long as the container exists. if a container is deleted or re-created in k8s, data stored on the container file system is lost

Volumes:
volumes allow you to store data outside the container file system while allowing the container to access the data at runtime. this can allow data to persist beyond the life of the container

volumes offer a simple way to provide external storage to containers within the pods/conatainer spec.

Persistent volumes are a slightly more advanced form of Volume. they allow you to treat storage as an abstract resource and consume it using your pods.

Volume types:
both volumes and Persistent volumes each have a volume type.  The volume type determines how the storage is actually handled. various volume types support storage methods such as: 
1. NFS
2. Cloud storage mechanisms (AWS, Azure, GCP)
3. ConfigMaps and Secrets
4. a simple directory on the k8s node

regular volumes can be set up relatively easily within a pos/container specification
volumes: in the pod spec, these specify the storage volumes available to the pod. they specify the volume type and other data that determines where and how the data is actually stored. 
volumeMounts: in the container spec, these reference he volumes in the Pod spec and provide a mountPath (the location on the file system where the container process will access the volume data)

Sharing Volumes between containers:
you can use volumesMounts to mount the same volume to multiple containers within the same pod.
this is a powerful way to have multiple containers interact with one another. For example, you could create a secondary sidecar container that processes or transforms output from another container.

Common Volume types:
there are many volume types, but there are two you may want to be especially aware of:
1. hostPath: stores data in a specified directory on the k8s node
2. emptyDir: stores data in a dynamically created location on the node. this directory exists only as long as the pod exist on the node. the directory and the data are deleted when the pod is removed. this volume type is very useful for simply sharing data between containers in the same pod


Let's break down each of these concepts in Kubernetes:

### Persistent Volume (PV):

- **Definition**: A Persistent Volume (PV) is a piece of storage in the cluster that has been provisioned by an administrator.
- **Lifecycle**: PVs have an independent lifecycle from pods and persist until explicitly released or deleted by the administrator.
- **Access Modes**: PVs support different access modes like ReadWriteOnce (RWO), ReadOnlyMany (ROX), and ReadWriteMany (RWX).
- **Usage**: PVs are used by PersistentVolumeClaims (PVCs) to provide storage to pods.

### Storage Class:

- **Definition**: A StorageClass is used to define different classes of storage with varying performance characteristics and features.
- **Dynamic Provisioning**: StorageClasses enable dynamic provisioning of PVs based on PVCs, allowing Kubernetes clusters to automatically provision and manage storage resources as needed.
- **Parameters**: StorageClasses can specify parameters such as provisioner, reclaimPolicy, volumeBindingMode, and others to define the behavior of dynamically provisioned PVs.
- **Usage**: PVCs reference a StorageClass to request storage with specific characteristics.

### Persistent Volume Claim (PVC):

- **Definition**: A PersistentVolumeClaim (PVC) is a request for storage made by pods to dynamically provision and bind to PVs.
- **Usage**: Pods consume storage by referencing PVCs in their configuration.
- **Access Modes**: PVCs specify the access mode (e.g., RWO, ROX, RWX) required for the requested storage.
- **Binding**: When a PVC is created, Kubernetes attempts to find a matching PV and binds them together.
- **Lifecycle**: PVCs are namespace-scoped and exist until they are deleted by the user.

### Resizing Persistent Volumes:

- **Dynamic Provisioning**: For dynamically provisioned PVs (using a StorageClass), resizing can often be done dynamically by updating the PVC's `resources.requests.storage` field.
- **Static Provisioning**: For statically provisioned PVs, resizing typically involves manually resizing the underlying storage outside of Kubernetes and then updating the PV's size manually.
- **Online Resize**: Some storage solutions support online resizing, allowing PVs to be resized without disrupting pod access to the storage.

Resizing PVs in Kubernetes requires careful consideration and coordination with the underlying storage solution to ensure data integrity and availability. It's essential to review the documentation and best practices provided by your storage provider and Kubernetes distribution before attempting to resize PVs. Additionally, it's recommended to test resizing procedures in a non-production environment before applying them to production workloads.


The "slow" and "fast" options you mentioned are not standard terms in Kubernetes storage configuration. However, they might be used colloquially or within specific contexts to describe different storage classes with varying performance characteristics.

In Kubernetes, storage classes are used to define different classes of storage with varying performance characteristics and features. These characteristics are typically determined by the underlying storage infrastructure, such as disk type (e.g., SSD, HDD), storage provider, or cloud storage service.

Here's how you might define storage classes with different performance characteristics:

### Example Storage Classes:

1. **Slow Storage Class**:
   - This storage class might be associated with slower, lower-performance storage options, such as traditional spinning hard disk drives (HDDs) or lower-tier cloud storage offerings.
   - It could have parameters configured to prioritize cost-effectiveness and capacity over performance.

```yaml
kind: StorageClass
apiVersion: storage.k8s.io/v1
metadata:
  name: slow-storage
provisioner: example.com/slow
parameters:
  type: slow
  ...
```

2. **Fast Storage Class**:
   - This storage class might be associated with faster, higher-performance storage options, such as solid-state drives (SSDs), high-performance disk arrays, or premium-tier cloud storage offerings.
   - It could have parameters configured to prioritize performance and low-latency access.

```yaml
kind: StorageClass
apiVersion: storage.k8s.io/v1
metadata:
  name: fast-storage
provisioner: example.com/fast
parameters:
  type: fast
  ...
```

In these examples, `slow-storage` and `fast-storage` are arbitrary names given to the storage classes to reflect their performance characteristics. The actual parameters and configuration would depend on the storage provider or infrastructure being used.

When provisioning PersistentVolumes (PVs) dynamically using these storage classes, users can select the appropriate class based on their application's requirements for performance, durability, and cost.

It's important to note that the terms "slow" and "fast" are subjective and relative to the specific context and requirements of your applications. Always consult with your storage administrator or provider to understand the performance characteristics and capabilities of the storage options available in your environment.
