the smallest thing (object) we can deploy in k8s is pod. inside of each pod we can have one or more containers

Kubernetes is a portable, extensible, open source platform for managing containerized workloads and services, that facilitates both declarative configuration and automation.

Main features:
1. Container Orchestration: the primary purpose of k8s is to dynamically mangage containers across multiple host systems
2. Application Reliability: k8s makes it easier to build reliable, self-healing, and scalable applications
3. Automation: k8s offers a variety of features to help automate the management of your container apps. 

Kubernetes, often abbreviated as K8s (with "8" representing the eight letters between "K" and "s" in "Kubernetes"), is an open-source container orchestration platform. It automates the deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications. Originally developed by Google and now maintained by the Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF), Kubernetes provides a platform for automating the deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications.

Here are some key concepts and components of Kubernetes:

1. **Container Orchestration**: Kubernetes manages containerized applications in a clustered environment. It abstracts underlying infrastructure, allowing developers to focus on application development without worrying about the underlying infrastructure.

2. **Cluster**: A Kubernetes cluster is a set of nodes (physical or virtual machines) that run containerized applications. Each cluster consists of one or more master nodes and multiple worker nodes.

3. **Master Node**: The master node is responsible for managing the cluster and scheduling tasks. It includes several components such as the Kubernetes API server, scheduler, controller manager, and etcd (key-value store for cluster data).

4. **Worker Node**: Worker nodes, also known as minion nodes, are the machines where containers are deployed and run. Each worker node runs several components, including the Kubelet (agent that communicates with the master node), container runtime (such as Docker), and kube-proxy (network proxy for forwarding traffic).

5. **Pod**: The smallest deployable unit in Kubernetes is a pod, which represents a single instance of a running container. Pods can contain one or more containers that are tightly coupled and share resources, such as network and storage volumes.

6. **Deployment**: A deployment is a Kubernetes resource that manages a set of identical pods, ensuring that a specified number of replicas are running and handling updates and rollbacks of application containers.

7. **Service**: Kubernetes service is an abstraction that defines a logical set of pods and a policy by which to access them. It enables networking and load balancing across multiple pods, providing a stable endpoint for accessing the application.

8. **Namespace**: Namespaces are virtual clusters within a Kubernetes cluster, allowing multiple users (or teams) to share the same physical cluster without interfering with each other. They provide isolation and scope for resources within a cluster.

9. **Labels and Selectors**: Labels are key-value pairs attached to Kubernetes objects (such as pods, services, and deployments) to organize and select subsets of resources. Selectors are used to query and filter resources based on labels.

Kubernetes has become the de facto standard for container orchestration due to its robust feature set, scalability, and vibrant ecosystem of tools and extensions. It provides a powerful platform for managing containerized applications in production environments.
