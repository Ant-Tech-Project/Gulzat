Certainly! Here's a summary of the branching rules and workflows outlined in the provided documentation:

### **Branching Rules Summary:**

The branching rules enforce a specific naming convention for branches within designated project groups. The regex rule `^(release\/v\d+(\.\d+)?|(feature|fix)\/[A-Z]{2,16}-\d+-.*)$` enforces the following:

#### **Feature Branch (child):**
- Naming: `feature/{JIRA-ID}-{subject-short-name}`
- Workflow: 
  1. Create a new branch from Development Base Branch.
  2. Develop the feature.
  3. Squash the feature branch.
  4. Rebase with the Development Base Branch.
  5. Test and create a merge request.

#### **Hotfix Branch (child):**
- Naming: `fix/{JIRA-ID}-{subject-short-name}`
- Workflow: 
  1. Create a new branch from the Release Branch.
  2. Implement the hotfix.
  3. Squash the hotfix branch.
  4. Rebase with the Release Branch.
  5. Test and create a merge request.

#### **Release Branch (base/child):**
- Naming: `release/v{major}`
- Workflow:
  1. Create a branch for major releases.
  2. Decide on features/bugfixes for the release.
  3. Create a release branch from the Development Base Branch.

#### **Development Branch (base):**
- Default branch used for joint work on future versions.
- Allows breaking backward compatibility with product owner approval.

### **Key Points:**
- Feature and hotfix branches follow specific naming conventions.
- Release branches are optional and used for maintaining major versions with backward compatibility.
- Development Branch is used for collaborative work on future versions.
- Strict workflows involve branching, development, squashing, rebasing, testing, and creating merge requests.
- Naming conventions help maintain consistency and traceability.

### **Diagrams:**
- Diagrams illustrate branching structures and workflows for feature, hotfix, and release branches.


Certainly! Here's a summarized version of the provided GitLab project configuration instructions:

1. **Use Fast-Forward Merge Method:**
   - Go to Settings -> General -> Merge requests -> Merge method.
   - Select "Fast-forward merge."

2. **Always Delete Source Branch on Merge:**
   - Go to Settings -> General -> Merge requests -> Merge options.
   - Enable the "Delete source branch" option by default.

3. **Always Squash Source Branch Before Merging:**
   - Go to Settings -> General -> Merge requests -> Squash commits when merging.
   - Select "Encourage."

4. **Only Allow Merge Requests to be Merged if the Pipeline Succeeds and All Threads Are Resolved:**
   - Go to Settings -> General -> Merge requests -> Merge checks.
   - Select "Pipelines must succeed" and "All threads must be resolved."

5. **Enable Email Notifications on Failed Pipelines:**
   - Ensure email notifications for failed pipelines are enabled.
   - Configure notifications for Failed pipeline events to be sent to the author of the pipeline.

6. **Manual Stages in Pipelines:**
   - If using manual stages in GitLab pipelines, push the "Play" button to trigger manual stages.
   - This is crucial, especially if post-merge steps are executed that may impact infrastructure.

7. **Perform Housekeeping for Infrastructure:**
   - Destroy infrastructure if needed for sporadic time slots or random test cases.
   - Use tools like Terraform to manage and destroy infrastructure.

8. **Allow_Failure: False for Housekeeping Stages:**
   - Set `allow_failure` to `false` in `.gitlab-ci.yml` for housekeeping stages.
   - This ensures that notifications are received in case of failures via email or Slack channels.

The provided GitLab CI/CD configuration instructions cover best practices for merge methods, branch deletion, squashing, merge request checks, email notifications, manual stages, and housekeeping for infrastructure. Following these practices helps maintain a reliable and streamlined development workflow.

The rules and workflows aim to provide a structured approach to collaborative development, hotfixes, and major releases within the specified project groups.What is Continuous Intergration?
Automation of repetitive task, executed every time we push a change to the mainline. We push to the mainline frequently but we do not trust our automation process
Steps:
1. Push to mainline often at least once a day
2. Automated pipelines, which makes a branch of tasks
3. Limited trust in automation
4. Use PRS to validate changes
5. Fixing failures has the highest priority 

What is Continuous Delivery?
1. Fully automated until production releases (started we push our changes to main)
2. Full trust in the automated processes
3. an extension of continuous integration (its not coming after CI), it means that we are ready to deliver something to production. So it means, that in CD we are doing the same as in CI  and a little more. But it is not separate process. CD process is starting when we pushing changes and ending when with having a validated release which is deployable to production at any moment
4. Every "green" build is deployable to production

What is Continuous Deployment: everything the same as Continuous Delivery except there is no buttom "Deploy Release"
1. Fully automated including deployment to production


Continuous Integration (CI), Continuous Delivery (CD), and Continuous Deployment (CD) are concepts in software development that involve automating and streamlining the processes of building, testing, and delivering software. While these terms are related, they represent different stages in the software delivery pipeline.

### Continuous Integration (CI):

1. **Definition:**
   - CI is a development practice where developers integrate code changes into a shared repository frequently, typically several times a day. Each integration is verified by automated build and test processes to detect integration issues early.

2. **Key Concepts:**
   - Frequent integration of code changes.
   - Automated build and test processes.
   - Early detection of integration issues.
   - Focus on maintaining a working and consistent codebase.

3. **Purpose:**
   - Reduce integration problems.
   - Facilitate collaboration among developers.
   - Provide rapid feedback on code changes.

### Continuous Delivery (CD):

1. **Definition:**
   - CD is an extension of CI that goes beyond automated testing to ensure that code changes are always in a deployable state. It involves automating the entire software delivery process, including testing, configuration, and deployment to production-like environments.

2. **Key Concepts:**
   - Automated testing and verification.
   - Automated deployment to staging or production-like environments.
   - Ensuring that every code change is deployable.

3. **Purpose:**
   - Accelerate the release process.
   - Minimize manual intervention in the deployment process.
   - Increase the reliability and repeatability of deployments.

### Continuous Deployment (CD):

1. **Definition:**
   - CD is the practice of automatically deploying every code change that passes the automated tests directly to production without manual intervention. It represents the highest level of automation in the software delivery pipeline.

2. **Key Concepts:**
   - Automated deployment to production.
   - Minimal or no manual intervention in the deployment process.
   - High level of confidence in the automated testing process.

3. **Purpose:**
   - Accelerate the time from code changes to production deployment.
   - Increase the frequency of releases.
   - Enable rapid and reliable delivery of new features or fixes.

### Summary:

- **CI:** Involves integrating code changes frequently, with automated build and test processes to detect integration issues early in development.

- **CDeliver:** Extends CI to include automated testing and deployment to staging or production-like environments, ensuring that code changes are always in a deployable state.

- **CDeployment:** Takes CD to the highest level of automation, automatically deploying every code change that passes automated tests directly to production without manual intervention.

These practices are often collectively referred to as CI/CD, emphasizing the integration and automation aspects of the software delivery pipeline. The choice between Continuous Delivery and Continuous Deployment depends on factors such as the organization's risk tolerance and the need for additional manual validation before deploying to production.
