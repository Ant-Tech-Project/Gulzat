Define Version Control
Version control, also known as source control or revision control, is a system and methodology used in software development to manage changes to the source code, documents, and other files associated with a project. The primary goal of version control is to track and coordinate modifications made by multiple contributors over time, enabling collaboration, maintaining a history of changes, and facilitating the management of different versions of a project.
Key aspects of version control include:
1. **History Tracking:**
   - Version control systems (VCS) keep a historical record of changes made to files over time. Each change, or "commit," is documented with details such as the author, timestamp, and a description of the modifications.
2. **Collaboration:**
   - Version control allows multiple developers to work on the same project simultaneously. Developers can work on separate branches and later merge their changes, reducing conflicts and facilitating collaboration.
3. **Branching and Merging:**
   - Version control systems support branching, allowing developers to create isolated copies of the codebase. Branches can be used for new features, bug fixes, or experimentation. Merging combines changes from one branch into another.
4. **Concurrency Control:**
   - Version control ensures that changes made by different contributors do not conflict with each other. When conflicts arise, the system provides mechanisms to resolve them.
5. **Reproducibility:**
   - Version control enables the reproduction of any past state of the project. This is valuable for debugging, testing, or reverting to a previous version if a problem is discovered.
6. **Rollback and Undo:**
   - Developers can roll back to a previous state of the project if needed. This is useful for undoing changes that introduced errors or undesirable behavior.
7. **Documentation:**
   - Commit messages and annotations serve as documentation for changes made to the codebase. They help developers understand the context and purpose of modifications.
8. **Continuous Integration:**
   - Version control is often integrated with continuous integration systems, allowing automated testing and validation of changes as they are committed to the repository.
9. **Distributed Version Control:**
   - Some version control systems, like Git and Mercurial, are distributed, meaning that each user has a complete copy of the repository, including its history. This decentralization provides flexibility and resilience.
