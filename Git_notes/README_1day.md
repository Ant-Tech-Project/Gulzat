1. Define Version Control
Short: "Version control is a system that tracks changes in software code. It helps multiple developers collaborate, keeps a history of changes, allows for easy branching and merging, and provides benefits like rollback, reproducibility, and automated testing for better code quality."
Long" Version control, also known as source control or revision control, is a system and methodology used in software development to manage changes to the source code, documents, and other files associated with a project. The primary goal of version control is to track and coordinate modifications made by multiple contributors over time, enabling collaboration, maintaining a history of changes, and facilitating the management of different versions of a project.
Key aspects of version control include:
1. **History Tracking:**
   - Version control systems (VCS) keep a historical record of changes made to files over time. Each change, or "commit," is documented with details such as the author, timestamp, and a description of the modifications.
2. **Collaboration:**
   - Version control allows multiple developers to work on the same project simultaneously. Developers can work on separate branches and later merge their changes, reducing conflicts and facilitating collaboration.
3. **Branching and Merging:**
   - Version control systems support branching, allowing developers to create isolated copies of the codebase. Branches can be used for new features, bug fixes, or experimentation. Merging combines changes from one branch into another.
4. **Concurrency Control:**
   - Version control ensures that changes made by different contributors do not conflict with each other. When conflicts arise, the system provides mechanisms to resolve them.
5. **Reproducibility:**
   - Version control enables the reproduction of any past state of the project. This is valuable for debugging, testing, or reverting to a previous version if a problem is discovered.
6. **Rollback and Undo:**
   - Developers can roll back to a previous state of the project if needed. This is useful for undoing changes that introduced errors or undesirable behavior.
7. **Documentation:**
   - Commit messages and annotations serve as documentation for changes made to the codebase. They help developers understand the context and purpose of modifications.
8. **Continuous Integration:**
   - Version control is often integrated with continuous integration systems, allowing automated testing and validation of changes as they are committed to the repository.
9. **Distributed Version Control:**
   - Some version control systems, like Git and Mercurial, are distributed, meaning that each user has a complete copy of the repository, including its history. This decentralization provides flexibility and resilience.

2. What is GIT purpose and its feature?

"Git is a distributed version control system, allowing each developer a full copy of the repository. It excels in branching, merging, and offline work. Other systems, often centralized, may lack these features and can be less flexible in handling parallel development."
**Purpose of Git:**
- **Version Control:** Git is primarily used for version control, enabling developers to track changes, collaborate, and manage different versions of their code.

**Key Features of Git:**
1. **Distributed Version Control:**
   - Git is a distributed version control system (DVCS), allowing each developer to have a complete copy of the code repository. This enables offline work and provides redundancy.
2. **Branching and Merging:**
   - Git excels in branching and merging, making it easy for developers to work on separate features or bug fixes in isolation and later merge changes back into the main codebase.
3. **History Tracking:**
   - Git maintains a detailed history of changes, including who made the changes, when, and why. This history is crucial for understanding the evolution of the codebase.
4. **Collaboration:**
   - Git facilitates collaboration among developers by providing a platform for sharing code, resolving conflicts, and working on the same project concurrently.
5. **Speed and Performance:**
   - Git is designed for speed and efficiency, allowing quick commits, branching, and merging operations. This contributes to a smooth development workflow.
6. **Data Integrity:**
   - Git ensures the integrity of code data through its content-addressable storage. Each change is represented by a unique hash, and any corruption or tampering is easily detectable.
7. **Flexible Workflows:**
   - Git supports various workflows, including feature branching, Gitflow, and others. This flexibility accommodates different development practices and team structures.
8. **Open Source:**
   - Git is open-source software, meaning its source code is freely available for inspection and modification. This has contributed to its widespread adoption and continuous improvement.
9. **Ease of Branching and Tagging:**
   - Creating branches and tags in Git is straightforward. Branches facilitate parallel development, while tags mark specific points in history (e.g., releases) for easy reference.
10. **Community and Ecosystem:**
    - Git has a large and active community, contributing to an extensive ecosystem of tools, extensions, and integrations that enhance its functionality.
11. **Staging Area (Index):**
    - Git includes a staging area (index) that allows developers to selectively choose which changes to include in the next commit, providing granularity in managing modifications.
12. **Security and Access Control:**
    - Git allows for access control through authentication mechanisms and permissions, ensuring that only authorized individuals can make changes to the repository.
13. **Compatibility:**
    - Git is compatible with various platforms and supports integration with popular development environments and continuous integration tools.
Understanding these features and leveraging them effectively helps developers and teams streamline their development processes and maintain a robust version control system.

3. What is drawbacks (недостатки) of not using Version Control System?

1. **Lack of History Tracking:**
   - Without version control, there is no systematic way to track changes made to the codebase over time. Developers lose the ability to review, understand, or revert to specific versions of the project.
2. **Difficulty in Collaboration:**
   - Collaboration becomes challenging when multiple developers are working on the same project. It's hard to manage changes made by different team members, leading to potential conflicts and coordination issues.
3. **Risk of Data Loss:**
   - Without version control, accidental overwrites or deletions of files can lead to permanent data loss. There's no backup or history to recover from, making it difficult to restore the project to a previous state.
4. **Limited Experimentation:**
   - Developers may be hesitant to experiment with new features or changes without version control. Fear of breaking the codebase can stifle creativity and hinder the exploration of innovative ideas.
5. **No Rollback Capability:**
   - The absence of version control means there's no straightforward way to roll back to a previous, stable state of the code in case of errors, bugs, or undesired changes.
6. **Manual Code Backup:**
   - Developers may resort to manual backups of their code by creating duplicate directories or files. This approach is error-prone, lacks organization, and doesn't provide the benefits of a systematic versioning system.
7. **Code Conflicts and Merging Challenges:**
   - When changes made by different developers are not tracked, integrating their work becomes error-prone. Conflicts are harder to identify, and merging code changes manually becomes a complex and error-prone task.
8. **Reduced Code Quality:**
   - Lack of version control can result in a less organized and maintainable codebase. Code quality may suffer due to the absence of tools for tracking code metrics, conducting code reviews, and enforcing coding standards.
9. **Limited Collaboration Tools:**
    - Version control systems provide collaboration tools, such as issue tracking, code reviews, and integrated workflows. Without these tools, collaboration relies more on manual communication methods, potentially leading to inefficiencies.

4. What is difference between DVCS and CVCS?
Here is two articles which describe it more understandable:
1. https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/centralized-vs-distributed-version-control-which-one-should-we-choose/
2. https://chinmaya-sahoo.medium.com/what-is-version-control-centralized-vs-distributed-b91c84456e12
3. https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-What-is-Git%3F#:~:text=The%20staging%20area%20is%20a,area%E2%80%9D%20works%20just%20as%20well.
I added a very interesting difference between git and other VCS from the 3rd link:
1. **Other VCS (Delta-based Version Control):**
   - Traditional version control systems, like CVS or Subversion, typically store information as a set of changes or differences (deltas) between versions of files.
   - Each change is recorded as a set of modifications made to individual files. Over time, these systems accumulate a history of changes, where each version is derived from the previous one by applying a series of modifications.
2. **Git's Approach (Snapshot-based Version Control):**
   - Git, on the other hand, thinks of its data more like a series of snapshots or snapshots of a mini filesystem.
   - Every time you commit (save the state of your project), Git takes a complete snapshot of all your files at that moment and stores a reference to that snapshot. If files haven't changed since the last snapshot, Git doesn't store them again; it simply maintains a link to the previous identical files.
   - Git's data model is focused on capturing the entire state of the project at each commit, rather than recording individual changes.

Short version of differences!!!
Centralized VCS:
Single central repository.
Access dependency on central server.
Limited branching and merging flexibility.
History retrieval and commits involve server interaction.

Distributed VCS:
Each developer has a complete local repository.
Access independent of a central server.
Flexible branching and merging capabilities.
Immediate access to project history locally.

5. Installing Git in different OS

Git can be installed on the most common operating systems like Windows, Mac, and Linux. In fact, Git comes installed by default on most Mac and Linux machines!
Firstly, check for Git
git --version

1. Install Git on Windows
Navigate to the latest Git for Windows installer and download the latest version.
Once the installer has started, follow the instructions as provided in the Git Setup wizard screen until the installation is complete.
Open the windows command prompt (or Git Bash if you selected not to use the standard Git Windows Command Prompt during the Git installation).
Type git version to verify Git was installed.

2. Install Git on Mac
Most versions of MacOS will already have Git installed, and you can activate it through the terminal with git version. However, if you don't have Git installed for whatever reason, you can install the latest version of Git using one of several popular methods as listed below:
Install Git From an Installer
Navigate to the latest macOS Git Installer and download the latest version.
Once the installer has started, follow the instructions as provided until the installation is complete.
Open the command prompt "terminal" and type git version to verify Git was installed.
Note: git-scm is a popular and recommended resource for downloading Git on a Mac. The advantage of downloading Git from git-scm is that your download automatically starts with the latest version of Git. The download source is the same macOS Git Installer as referenced in the steps above.
Install Git from Homebrew
Homebrew is a popular package manager for macOS. If you already have Homwbrew installed, you can follow the below steps to install Git:
Open up a terminal window and install Git using the following command: brew install git.
Once the command output has completed, you can verify the installation by typing: git version.

3. Install Git on Linux
Fun fact: Git was originally developed to version the Linux operating system! So, it only makes sense that it is easy to configure to run on Linux.

You can install Git on Linux through the package management tool that comes with your distribution.
Debian/Ubuntu
Git packages are available using apt.
It's a good idea to make sure you're running the latest version. To do so, Navigate to your command prompt shell and run the following command to make sure everything is up-to-date: sudo apt-get update.
To install Git, run the following command: sudo apt-get install git-all.
Once the command output has completed, you can verify the installation by typing: git version.
Fedora
Git packages are available using dnf.
To install Git, navigate to your command prompt shell and run the following command: sudo dnf install git-all.
Once the command output has completed, you can verify the installation by typing: git version.
